# InterSystems IRIS Containerized Application Demo

This repository contains a sample application which consists of InterSystems IRIS REST API and Frontend Application for a hypothetical coffee-maker shop. 

It demonstrates the way to communicate with InterSystes IRIS from any frontend application and is being used in the Container Workshop to teach how to Containerize an IRIS application.

Enjoy the workshop!
