# Samples-Container-Workshop

This repository is a companion to the Containers Workshop at Global Summit 2023.

This workshop contains two parts. In Part 1, you will learn how to interact with basic containers and use InterSystems IRIS in containers. In Part 2, you will build your own containerized InterSystems IRIS application based on a sample app for selling coffee makers.

By the time you have finished the workshop, you will be able to:
* Create, manage, and remove Docker containers.
* Distinguish between running containers and container images.
* Create new container images.
* Persist data using bind mounts.
* Use Durable %SYS directories for persisting InterSystems IRIS data.
* Create container images from build processes.
* Use Docker Compose for multi-container deployments.
* Use container registries to share and retrieve containers.
* Update containers in place while preserving your application and data.

Throughout this workshop, you will complete exercises and watch accompanying presentations from
InterSystems experts. Supporting materials will be linked in the provided slide deck in case you miss any of the presentations or wish to revisit the materials later.

Enjoy the Containers Workshop!
